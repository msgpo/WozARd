### What is WozARd?

WozARd is a Wizard of Oz tool for mobile augmented reality. Wizard of Oz methodology is useful when conducting user studies of a system that is in early development. It is essential to be able to simulate part of the system and to collect feedback from potential users. Using a human to act as the system is one way to do this.

WozARd aims at offering a set of tools that help a test leader control the visual, tactile and auditive output that is presented to test participant. Additionally, it is suitable for using in an augmented reality environment where images are overlaid on the phone’s camera view or on glasses.

The main features include presentation of media such as images, video and sound, navigation and location based triggering, automatically taking photos, capability to log test results and visual feedback. There is also an integration for Sony SmartWatch that offers interaction possibilities.

WozARd consists of three Android applications:
* Wizard. An application that is used by the test leader, which can control the puppet application.
* Puppet. An application that is running on the device used by the test participant.
* SmartWatch extension. An optional application that allows a test participant to perform touch taps and swipes that are sent to the wizard application.
